"# Decentralized applications (dApps) are digital applications or programs that exist and run on a blockchain or peer-to-peer (P2P) network of computers instead of a single computer. DApps  are outside the purview and control of a single authority. DApps—which are often built on the Ethereum platform—can be developed for a variety of purposes including gaming, finance, and social media."

"Database: The Ethereum’s Testnet Ropsten blockchain.
Hosting: IPFS to get free hosting forever in a decentralized platform.
Frontend: React.js with webpack. Don’t worry I’ll explain the most important steps. You can use whatever framework you like or plain javascript.
Domain name: Godaddy. Here I could use some decentralized domain service like peername but it’s just faster and easier with godaddy or any other domain registrar.
Contract’s programing language: Solidity 0.4.11, right now the most famous language for developing Smart Contracts.
Frontend contracts: web3.js to use those contracts in your web user interface.
Frameworks: Truffle to deploy, test and compile our contracts.
Development server: Node.js to use the app while developing locally along with testrpc.
Metamask: To use the final application like the end user would."
